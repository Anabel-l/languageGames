Some code to play around with in my free time. It's got a pretty cool language generator, a poetry generator and more.

WordStructures is the language generator. 
Each time it generates word structures, word lengths, common vowels and common consonants for the new language.
There's a lot of ways to customize its language generation and it is a very powerful tool.

Languages is the original language generator.
It's not great. WordStructures is the updated language generator.

Dictionary takes WordStructures and creates an equivalent list of words for some of the most common words in English.
It can translate between the two languages, change the language and more.

DictionaryDriver is simply how the user interacts with Dictionary.

RhymeScheme creates poetry in a randomly generated language.
It's pretty simple.
